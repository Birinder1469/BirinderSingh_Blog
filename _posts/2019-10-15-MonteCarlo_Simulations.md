## Monte Carlo Simulation

Based on my understanding Monte Carlo Simulation is a technique to estimate the parameter of interest(otherwise difficult to compute) by carrying out computations on random numbers picked repeatedly from a distribution. Sounds complicate right. Let me make it a little more intuitive. Lets see if we want to find a area of a square, the obvious and more complex way is to sum the area of each and every fragment of material within the square.
