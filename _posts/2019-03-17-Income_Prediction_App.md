## Motivation

The motivation to do the analysis is to build an entire pipeline starting from the Exploratory Data Analysis to choice of Machine Learning model and then deployment on a microservice Heroku so that it can be used for analysis by anyone. The task is to is to determine whether a person makes over $50k a year.


## Dataset
The dataset is available on the UCI website under the name of Adult Data Set/Census Income.
