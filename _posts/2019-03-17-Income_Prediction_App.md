## Motivation

The motivation to do the analysis was to build the entire pipeline starting from the Exploratory Data
Analysis to choice of Machine Learning model and then deployment on a microservice Heroku.

## Objective

Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.

## Dataset
The dataset is available on the UCI website under the name of Adult Data Set/Census Income.
