## fast.ai Course Image classification
### About the course

While I was looking for some good courses on Deep Learning, my search ended when I came across this course by fast.ai: [Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3](https://course.fast.ai/). This is the part 1 of the two part series by fast.ai. Part 1 covers four applications:

1. Computer Vision
2. Natural Language Text
3. Collaborative filtering  
4. Tabular Data

The course teaches how to train PyTorch models using the fastai library. The instructor Jeremy is the cofounder of the Fast.ai.
